      <h2>Our Origin Story (Kind of)</h2>
      <p>It all started when Caedon accidentally brewed espresso instead of tea... and then drank all six shots. What followed was a burst of productivity, a three-hour deep dive into bean roasting techniques, and the birth of Caedon's Caffeinated Café. Was it a business plan or a caffeine-fueled fever dream? Yes.</p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>To serve dangerously delicious coffee, create a cozy haven for caffeine fiends, and to never—EVER—serve decaf unless it’s a prank or a dare. We believe coffee should slap you awake, not whisper you back to bed.</p>
